/**
 * Types and a small helper for the Faceclaw extension API.
 *
 * [Faceclaw](https://github.com/jimrandomh/faceclaw) is an alternative host for
 * EvenHub apps: it runs them on the Even Realities G2 glasses without the stock
 * Even app. An app built against the standard `@evenrealities/even_hub_sdk`
 * runs unchanged. This package lets such an app detect that it is running
 * inside Faceclaw and use a few extra, Faceclaw-only capabilities.
 *
 * The only entry point is the injected global `window.getFaceclawExtensions`,
 * which is a function inside Faceclaw and `undefined` in the stock Even app and
 * every other host. Nothing on the standard SDK, on `window`, or on any built-in
 * prototype is modified, so an app that uses these extensions still runs
 * everywhere else; it just skips the extras.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { getFaceclawExtensions } from "@faceclaw/evenhub-extensions";
 *
 * const fc = getFaceclawExtensions();
 * if (fc) {
 *   console.log("Running in", fc.getVersion()); // "Faceclaw/0.8.2"
 *   fc.addWindowLifecycleListener((e) => {
 *     if (e.type === "hidden") pauseExpensiveWork();
 *   });
 * }
 * ```
